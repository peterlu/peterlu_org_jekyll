    abstract = { Suspensions of solid micron-scale colloidal particles in liquid solvents are a foundational model system used to explore a wide range of phase transitions, including crystallization, gelation, spinodal decomposition, and the glass transition. One of the most commonly used systems for these investigations is the fluorescent spherical particles of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) suspended in a mixture of nonpolar solvents that match the density and the refractive index of the particles to minimize sedimentation and scattering. However, the particles can swell in these solvents, changing their size and density, and may leak the fluorescent dye over days to weeks; this constrains the exploration of slow and kinetically limited processes, such as near-boundary phase separation or the glass transition. In this paper, we produce PMMA colloidal particles that employ polymerizable and photostable cyanine-based fluorescent monomers spanning the range of visible wavelengths and a polymeric stabilizer prepared from polydimethylsiloxane, PDMS-graft-PMMA. Using microcalorimetry, we characterize the thermodynamics of an accelerated equilibration process for these dispersions in the buoyancy- and refractive-index-matching solvents. We use confocal differential dynamic microscopy to demonstrate that they behave as hard spheres. The suspended particles are stable for months to years, maintaining fixed particle size and density, and do not leak dye. Thus, these particles enable longer term experiments than may have been possible earlier; we demonstrate this by observing spinodal decomposition in a mixture of these particles with a depletant polymer in the microgravity environment of the International Space Station. Using fluorescence microscopy, we observe coarsening over several months and measure the growth of the characteristic length scale to be a fraction of a picometer per second; this rate is among the slowest observed in a phase-separating system. Our protocols should facilitate the synthesis of a variety of particles. },

abstract={Differential Dynamic Microscopy (DDM) analyzes traditional real-space microscope images to extract information on sample dynamics in a way akin to light scattering, by decomposing each image in a sequence into Fourier modes, and evaluating their time correlation properties. DDM has been applied in a number of soft-matter and colloidal systems. However, objects observed to move out of the microscope's captured field of view, intersecting the edges of the acquired images, can introduce spurious but significant errors in the subsequent analysis. Here we show that application of a spatial windowing filter to images in a sequence before they enter the standard DDM analysis can reduce these artifacts substantially. Moreover, windowing can increase significantly the accessible range of wave vectors probed by DDM, and may further yield unexpected information, such as the size polydispersity of a colloidal suspension.},

    abstract = { Confocal microscopy is widely used for three-dimensional (3D) sample reconstructions. Arguably, the most significant challenge in such reconstructions is posed by the resolution along the optical axis being significantly lower than in the lateral directions. In addition, the imaging rate is lower along the optical axis in most confocal architectures, prohibiting reliable 3D reconstruction of dynamic samples. Here, we demonstrate a very simple, cheap, and generic method of multiangle microscopy, allowing high-resolution high-rate confocal slice collection to be carried out with capillary-contained colloidal samples in a wide range of slice orientations. This method, realizable with any common confocal architecture and recently implemented with macroscopic specimens enclosed in rotatable cylindrical capillaries, allows 3D reconstructions of colloidal structures to be verified by direct experiments and provides a solid testing ground for complex reconstruction algorithms. In this paper, we focus on the implementation of this method for dense nonrotatable colloidal samples, contained in complex-shaped capillaries. Additionally, we discuss strategies to minimize potential pitfalls of this method, such as the artificial appearance of chain-like particle structures. },

We rectify this problem by replacing all asymmetric kernels with rotationally-symmetric kernels, which does not impact code performance. We show that these corrected codes locate particle positions properly, restoring measured isotropy to colloidal fluids. We also investigate rapidly-formed colloidal sediments, and with the corrected codes show that these sediments, often thought to be amorphous, may exhibit strong orientational correlations among bonds between neighboring colloidal particles.},

	pages = {499-503},
	abstract = {Nanoscale or colloidal particles are important in many realms of science and technology. They can dramatically change the properties of materials, imparting solid-like behaviour to a wide variety of complex fluids. This behaviour arises when particles aggregate to form mesoscopic clusters and networks. The essential component leading to aggregation is an interparticle attraction, which can be generated by many physical and chemical mechanisms. In the limit of irreversible aggregation, infinitely strong interparticle bonds lead to diffusion-limited cluster aggregation (DLCA). This is understood as a purely kinetic phenomenon that can form solid-like gels at arbitrarily low particle volume fraction. Far more important technologically are systems with weaker attractions, where gel formation requires higher volume fractions. Numerous scenarios for gelation have been proposed, including DLCA, kinetic or dynamic arrest, phase separation, percolation and jamming. No consensus has emerged and, despite its ubiquity and significance, gelation is far from understood{\textemdash}even the location of the gelation phase boundary is not agreed on. Here we report experiments showing that gelation of spherical particles with isotropic, short-range attractions is initiated by spinodal decomposition; this thermodynamic instability triggers the formation of density fluctuations, leading to spanning clusters that dynamically arrest to create a gel. This simple picture of gelation does not depend on microscopic system-specific details, and should thus apply broadly to any particle system with short-range attractions. Our results suggest that gelation{\textemdash}often considered a purely kinetic phenomenon{\textemdash}is in fact a direct consequence of equilibrium liquid{\textendash}gas phase separation. Without exception, we observe gelation in all of our samples predicted by theory and simulation to phase-separate; this suggests that it is phase separation, not percolation, that corresponds to gelation in models for attractive spheres.},

I demonstrate that the gelation of spherical particles with isotropic, short-range attractive interactions is initiated by spinodal decomposition, a thermodynamic instability that triggers the formation of clusters that span and dynamically arrest to create a gel. This simple, universal gelation picture does not depend on microscopic system-specific details thus broadly describing any particle system with short-range attractions and suggests that gelation, often considered a purely kinetic phenomenon, is in fact a direct consequence of equilibrium liquid-gas phase separation. I also demonstrate that spherical particles with isotropic attractive interactions exhibit a stable phase a fluid of particle clusters that persists on experimental timescales even in the absence of any long-range Coulombic charge repulsion; this contrasts some expectations based on simulation and theory. I describe a new capability I created by integrating accelerated image processing software that I wrote into a high-speed confocal microscope system that I developed: active target-locking, the ability to follow freely-moving complex objects within a microscope sample, even as they change size, shape, and orientation in real time. Finally, I report continuous, month-long observations of near-critical spinodal decomposition of colloids with isotropic attractions, aboard the International Space Station.

	abstract = {The conventional view holds that girih (geometric star-and-polygon, or strapwork) patterns in medieval Islamic architecture were conceived by their designers as a network of zigzagging lines, where the lines were drafted directly with a straightedge and a compass. We show that by 1200 C.E. a conceptual breakthrough occurred in which girih patterns were reconceived as tessellations of a special set of equilateral polygons ("girih tiles") decorated with lines. These tiles enabled the creation of increasingly complex periodic girih patterns, and by the 15th century, the tessellation approach was combined with self-similar transformations to construct nearly perfect quasi-crystalline Penrose patterns, five centuries before their discovery in the West.},

	abstract = {We present a real-time target-locking confocal microscope that follows an object moving along an arbitrary path, even as it simultaneously changes its shape, size and orientation. This Target-locking Acquisition with Realtime Confocal (TARC) microscopy system integrates fast image processing and rapid image acquisition using a Nipkow spinning-disk confocal microscope. The system acquires a 3D stack of images, performs a full structural analysis to locate a feature of interest, moves the sample in response, and then collects the next 3D image stack. In this way, data collection is dynamically adjusted to keep a moving object centered in the field of view. We demonstrate the system{\textquoteright}s capabilities by target-locking freely-diffusing clusters of attractive colloidal particles, and activelytransported quantum dots (QDs) endocytosed into live cells free to move in three dimensions, for several hours. During this time, both the colloidal clusters and live cells move distances several times the length of the imaging volume.},

	year = {2006},
	pages = {2736-2739},
	abstract = {Long-term evolutionary dynamics have been approached through quantitative analysis of the fossil record, but without explicitly taking its incompleteness into account. Here we explore the temporal covariance structure of per-genus origination and extinction rates for global marine fossil genera throughout the Phanerozoic, both before and after corrections for the incompleteness of the fossil record. Using uncorrected data based on Sepkoski{\textquoteright}s compendium, we find significant autocovariance within origination and extinction rates, as well as covariance between extinction and origination, not one, but two, intervals later, corroborating evidence for the unexplained temporal gap found by past studies. However, these effects vanish when the data are corrected for the incompleteness of the fossil record. Instead, we observe significant covariance only between extinction and origination in the immediately following intervals. The gap in the response of the biosphere to extinction in the uncorrected fossil record thus appears to be an artifact of the incompleteness of the fossil record, specifically due to episodic variation in the probability that taxa will be preserved, on time scales comparable to the temporal resolution of Sepkoski{\textquoteright}s data. Our results also indicate that at that temporal resolution (the stage/substage of duration ≈5 million years), changes in origination and extinction do not persist for longer than one interval, except that elevated origination rates immediately after extinction may last for more than a single interval. Thus, although certain individual cases may deviate from the overall pattern, we find that in general the biosphere{\textquoteright}s response to perturbation is immediate geologically and usually short-lived.},

	abstract = { The majority of prehistoric lithic artefacts were fashioned from rocks and minerals no harder than quartz, and there is no prehistoric evidence for the working of harder materials, such as corundum and diamond. The earliest physical evidence for the use of corundum (ruby, sapphire) is thought to be the abrasive grit recovered from Bronze Age Minoan quartz beads (c. 1700{\textendash}1500 bc), while diamond is thought to have been used no earlier than 500 bc, in India. Here we show that corundum was worked c. 4000{\textendash}3500 bc during the Neolithic period in China, in the form of polished axes from the Liangzhu and Sanxingcun cultures. We also present physical evidence that later Liangzhu axes (c. 2500 bc), made from the same previously undescribed rock whose most abundant component is corundum, were polished to a mirror-like finish with a diamond abrasive. Our findings, which are the first to support the use of corundum and diamond in a prehistoric context, may also help to explain the trademark feature of the Neolithic in China, vast quantities of finely polished nephrite jade artefacts.},

	year = {2000},

	type = {Undergraduate Senior Thesis},
	abstract = {Having examples of quasicrystals with a large variety of compositions and stoichiometries
is important in exploring physical properties and finding practical applications.
The discovery of newquasicrystals has historically depended on serendipity. The goal
of this thesis is determine if a more systematic approach can be developed. Based on
a theoretical understanding of quasicrystal diffraction properties, a computer search
scheme has been developed to identify icosahedral quasicrystals based on records in
the international Powder Diffraction File, a collection of about 70,000 x-ray powder
diffraction patterns. The scheme is first tested by determining if it can successfully
identify and index the known icosahedral patterns in agreement with published analyses.
Then, the scheme is applied to the remainder of the Powder Diffraction File
(materials described as crystalline) to identify the most promising quasicrystal candidates.
The leading candidates are examined with electron microscopy. The electron
diffraction patterns of the most thoroughly investigated of the mineral candidates to
date, krennerite, strongly indicates that it is an incommensurately modulated crystal,
only the second such incommensurate mineral known. The fact that the mineral
arose from a search for icosahedral quasicrystals means that its structure is not only
incommensurate, but the incommensurate ratios of diffraction wavevectors are simply
related to the golden ratio. A generic incommensurate crystal can have arbitrary
irrational ratios. The finding suggests that the incommensurability may be related
to an icosahedral phase, perhaps one obtained by varying the stoichiometry slightly.
The system merits synthesis and further testing in the laboratory.},
