Colloids are small enough that thermal energy drives their dynamics and ensures equilibration with the suspending fluid and are also large enough that their positions and motions can be measured precisely using optical methods, such as light scattering and laser-scanning confocal fluorescence microscopy. Colloidal suspensions are a powerful model system for the study of other phenomena in condensed matter physics, where the collective phase behavior of the solid particles mimics that of other condensed systems. We review three classes of interacting colloidal particles, crystals, glasses, and gels, each of which represents fascinating properties of colloidal particles as well as a model for more general types of materials and their behavior.},

	abstract = {I present several scientific and technical contributions in this thesis. I demonstrate that the gelation of spherical particles with isotropic, short-range attractive interactions is initiated by spinodal decomposition, a thermodynamic instability that triggers the formation of clusters that span and dynamically arrest to create a gel. This simple, universal gelation picture does not depend on microscopic system-specific details thus broadly describing any particle system with short-range attractions and suggests that gelation, often considered a purely kinetic phenomenon, is in fact a direct consequence of equilibrium liquid-gas phase separation. I also demonstrate that spherical particles with isotropic attractive interactions exhibit a stable phase a fluid of particle clusters that persists on experimental timescales even in the absence of any long-range Coulombic charge repulsion; this contrasts some expectations based on simulation and theory. I describe a new capability I created by integrating accelerated image processing software that I wrote into a high-speed confocal microscope system that I developed: active target-locking, the ability to follow freely-moving complex objects within a microscope sample, even as they change size, shape, and orientation in real time. Finally, I report continuous, month-long observations of near-critical spinodal decomposition of colloids with isotropic attractions, aboard the International Space Station. I also include detailed descriptions, with examples and illustrations, of the tools and techniques that I have developed to produce these results.},

	pages = {499-503},
	abstract = {Nanoscale or colloidal particles are important in many realms of science and technology. They can dramatically change the properties of materials, imparting solid-like behaviour to a wide variety of complex fluids. This behaviour arises when particles aggregate to form mesoscopic clusters and networks. The essential component leading to aggregation is an interparticle attraction, which can be generated by many physical and chemical mechanisms. In the limit of irreversible aggregation, infinitely strong interparticle bonds lead to diffusion-limited cluster aggregation (DLCA). This is understood as a purely kinetic phenomenon that can form solid-like gels at arbitrarily low particle volume fraction. Far more important technologically are systems with weaker attractions, where gel formation requires higher volume fractions. Numerous scenarios for gelation have been proposed, including DLCA, kinetic or dynamic arrest, phase separation, percolation and jamming. No consensus has emerged and, despite its ubiquity and significance, gelation is far from understood{\textemdash}even the location of the gelation phase boundary is not agreed on. Here we report experiments showing that gelation of spherical particles with isotropic, short-range attractions is initiated by spinodal decomposition; this thermodynamic instability triggers the formation of density fluctuations, leading to spanning clusters that dynamically arrest to create a gel. This simple picture of gelation does not depend on microscopic system-specific details, and should thus apply broadly to any particle system with short-range attractions. Our results suggest that gelation{\textemdash}often considered a purely kinetic phenomenon{\textemdash}is in fact a direct consequence of equilibrium liquid{\textendash}gas phase separation. Without exception, we observe gelation in all of our samples predicted by theory and simulation to phase-separate; this suggests that it is phase separation, not percolation, that corresponds to gelation in models for attractive spheres.},

These tiles enabled the creation of increasingly complex periodic girih patterns, and by the 15th century, the tessellation approach was combined with self-similar transformations to construct nearly perfect quasi-crystalline Penrose patterns, five centuries before their discovery in the West.},

	pages = {2736-2739},
	abstract = {Long-term evolutionary dynamics have been approached through quantitative analysis of the fossil record, but without explicitly taking its incompleteness into account. Here we explore the temporal covariance structure of per-genus origination and extinction rates for global marine fossil genera throughout the Phanerozoic, both before and after corrections for the incompleteness of the fossil record. Using uncorrected data based on Sepkoski{\textquoteright}s compendium, we find significant autocovariance within origination and extinction rates, as well as covariance between extinction and origination, not one, but two, intervals later, corroborating evidence for the unexplained temporal gap found by past studies. However, these effects vanish when the data are corrected for the incompleteness of the fossil record. Instead, we observe significant covariance only between extinction and origination in the immediately following intervals. The gap in the response of the biosphere to extinction in the uncorrected fossil record thus appears to be an artifact of the incompleteness of the fossil record, specifically due to episodic variation in the probability that taxa will be preserved, on time scales comparable to the temporal resolution of Sepkoski{\textquoteright}s data. Our results also indicate that at that temporal resolution (the stage/substage of duration ≈5 million years), changes in origination and extinction do not persist for longer than one interval, except that elevated origination rates immediately after extinction may last for more than a single interval. Thus, although certain individual cases may deviate from the overall pattern, we find that in general the biosphere{\textquoteright}s response to perturbation is immediate geologically and usually short-lived.},

Here we show that corundum was worked c. 4000{\textendash}3500 bc during the Neolithic period in China, in the form of polished axes from the Liangzhu and Sanxingcun cultures. We also present physical evidence that later Liangzhu axes (c. 2500 bc), made from the same previously undescribed rock whose most abundant component is corundum, were polished to a mirror-like finish with a diamond abrasive. Our findings, which are the first to support the use of corundum and diamond in a prehistoric context, may also help to explain the trademark feature of the Neolithic in China, vast quantities of finely polished nephrite jade artefacts.},

	abstract = {Having examples of quasicrystals with a large variety of compositions and stoichiometries
is important in exploring physical properties and finding practical applications.
The discovery of newquasicrystals has historically depended on serendipity. The goal
of this thesis is determine if a more systematic approach can be developed. Based on
a theoretical understanding of quasicrystal diffraction properties, a computer search
scheme has been developed to identify icosahedral quasicrystals based on records in
the international Powder Diffraction File, a collection of about 70,000 x-ray powder
diffraction patterns. The scheme is first tested by determining if it can successfully
identify and index the known icosahedral patterns in agreement with published analyses.
Then, the scheme is applied to the remainder of the Powder Diffraction File
(materials described as crystalline) to identify the most promising quasicrystal candidates.
The leading candidates are examined with electron microscopy. The electron
diffraction patterns of the most thoroughly investigated of the mineral candidates to
date, krennerite, strongly indicates that it is an incommensurately modulated crystal,
only the second such incommensurate mineral known. The fact that the mineral
arose from a search for icosahedral quasicrystals means that its structure is not only
incommensurate, but the incommensurate ratios of diffraction wavevectors are simply
related to the golden ratio. A generic incommensurate crystal can have arbitrary
irrational ratios. The finding suggests that the incommensurability may be related
to an icosahedral phase, perhaps one obtained by varying the stoichiometry slightly.
The system merits synthesis and further testing in the laboratory.},
