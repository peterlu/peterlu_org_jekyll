Distinctive spiral grooves carved on ritual jade rings buried in tombs dating from China’s Spring and Autumn period (771–475 BC) follow a precise mathematical form described by the spiral of Archimedes, 300 years before he lived. I show how precisely drafting these spirals required a precision compound machine in 550 BC, preceding all other machines known to interconvert exactly linear and rotational motion by half a millennium. I also propose a basic mechanical design relying only upon technologies known to have existed at that time.
